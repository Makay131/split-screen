## Project Title

Split Screen Landing Page

## Project Description

This is a project for an artificial real-estate company that sells villas in two or desired amount of locations in Portugal. The Landing page divides into two parts. One for the villas in Albufeira, and the other one is for the villas in Porto.

Two of the sides have a heading and and explore button each. On hover of the sides, the particular one extends across the other one and at last grows a little smoothly.
Buttons are transformed up a bit and change state when hovering them with a nice effect. When the active side is hovered, the so called unactive side's heading becomes invisible for visual hierarchy.

For a possible future idea, it can be said that both buttons might lead to two different pages accordingly to the content, or either the whole landing page may be used in a component for a bigger project.
